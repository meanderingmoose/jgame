Simple Game

My game will be a side scrolling jumper/shooter, with the jumping part emulating the Mario game and the shooting part mostly the same but with the addition of a gun for the character. 
The name of my game will be The Return of Roami, and it is centered around the quest of Roami to escape the strange world he has found himself on. He is willing to do whatever it takes to make it past the enemies and obstacles and secure his freedom.
The goal for both the shooting and non-shooting levels of the game is the same: to make it past the enemies and obstacles which will be scrolling to the left in the way of Roami. There is no way to win the game; instead, a score is awarded for the amount of time Roami stays alive. 
The game will be played using the arrow keys and the z button. The z button, when Roami has a gun, will allow him to shoot bullets, which will take out any enemies they come into contact with. The arrow keys will allow Roami to move and avoid the obstacles and enemies. When Roami has a gun, which he acquires after completing a set number of levels, there will be more of an emphasis on using it to get rid of the enemies instead of jumping them or avoiding them. 
The two different levels of this game will be levels where Roami does not have a gun and levels where he does. The gun will change the way the user plays the game, as enemies can be shot from afar instead of just avoided. The gun levels will have more enemies to keep the difficulty relatively similar to the gunless levels.
